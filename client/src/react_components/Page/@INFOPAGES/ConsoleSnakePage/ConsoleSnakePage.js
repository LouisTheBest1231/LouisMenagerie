            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h5>Every programmer eventually makes this game :)</h5>
            <p>
                <span>Snake!!</span> is one of the first <span>Console Application</span> I ever made. It is a simple console game made 
                in <i>C#</i> with <i>Visual Studio</i>. Without any surprise, it is a recreation of the famous game of <span>Snake</span>, where a snake must collect 
                apples without hitting himself or boundaries. The twist of this version, is that everything is made in a console environnment. So the graphics
                are <span>ASCII characters!</span>
